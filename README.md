  ## Description 
  
  Tindfur is a dating profile where dogs can find true love.
    
  ## Installation 
  
  Required installations for Tindfur include React, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js. Once the aforementioned dependencies have been installed properly, run the command `npm install` in the command line to install the necessary packages.

  ## Usage 
  
  As a full-stack web application, Tindfur relies on both the client and server side. To start both sides of this application, run the command `npm run develop`. Once this command is run, the app will be launched on the port localhost:3000. By either copying and posting this port or hitting command click, you will be redirected to the homepage of Tindfur.

  Once the homepage has loaded, the user is presented with the option to sign up for an account or log in if an account already exists. Once the users information has been authenticated, the dog dating options are rendered to the screen. Here, the user can browse through all of the prospective dog dates and save their favorites (aka right swipes) to their personal favorites page.

  On the favorites page, each card contains the information of the saved dogs along with the option to remove any given dog from favorites.
